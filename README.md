2. **Navigate to the desired week's folder**:
    For Python:
    ```bash
    cd Shoelace-assignment/Python/Assignment-1
    ```
    For C:
    ```bash
    cd Shoelace-assignment/C/Assignment-1
    ```
3. **Run the Python programs**:
    ```bash
    python Prog1.py
    ```

4. **Compile and run the C programs**:
    First, compile the C program:
    ```bash
